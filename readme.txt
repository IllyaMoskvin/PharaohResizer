Pharaoh Resizer, by crudelios.
Created in 2016. Public domain and free for any use.

This program was created in order to help people resize their Pharaoh + Cleopatra to widescreen.

Currently it supports an horizontal resolution from 1024 to 7680 and a vertical resolution from 720
to 4320 (allowing for perfect usage on 8k screens!).

In order to compile the source code, you'll need to include the LZ4 library. LZ4 is a very fast
compression algorithm which is used to decompress my edited Pharaoh.exe that is included with
this program. Check the LZ4 license below in order to download it:
